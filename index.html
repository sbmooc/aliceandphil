      <img src="accomo.png" class="pure-img sectionTitle" id="accomo"> <p> If you
        are looking at staying for 1-2 nights, we recommend staying close to the
        wedding venue. We have a wedding discount of 35% and have reserved some
        rooms at the venue for the night of the wedding in the castle and tower.
      </p> <p> A double room in the tower is £100.28 (inc breakfast). A bigger
        room for 3 people (a double and a single bed) in the castle is £163.41 (inc
        breakfast). If you would like to take one of these rooms, please let us know
        ASAP. There are also villas, apartments and hotels available for short stays
        in the local town of La Bisbal or in the nearby villages of Monells, Púbol,
        Peratallada. </p> <p> If you are thinking of coming for a long weekend or
          more, we recommend that you stay on the coast and travel inland for the
          wedding celebrations. Bookings for private villas will likely open in the
          autumn. </p> <p> We will be staying close to Sa Riera and can recommend
            accommodation both there and in Begur, Sa Tuna, Tamariu and Calella de
            Palafrugell. Over the course of the weekend, we plan to arrange a few other
            events in these areas. More details to follow on that. </p> <p> Vicky
              (Alice’s mum) has worked in the area for many years and is keen to help with
              your accommodation search in any way she can. Think of her as your personal
              travel agent ☺ <a href='mailto: victoria@spanishescape.co.uk'>

                class="pure-img sectionTitle"> <p> When deciding when to travel, please bear
                  in mind that it is not only the long bank holiday weekend, but also the
                  first weekend of May half term. If possible, avoid peak flights by flying
                  Friday-Tuesday, for example. Secondly, the wedding will begin late on
                  Saturday afternoon (approx. 4pm) so you have the option to fly early on
                  Saturday morning, should that be more convenient.  </p> <p> There are two
                    options of airports: </p> <h4> Girona (GRO) </h4> <p> Approximately a 40
                      minute drive from where you are likely to stay Flights to Girona for May
                      2019 will only be released in October 2018, although Jet2 already have some
                      avaliable. </p> <p>Airlines:</p> <ul> <li>Ryanair <li>Tui <li>Jet2.com </ul>
                      </p> <h4> Barcelona El Prat (BCN) </h4>

                      <p> Approximately a 2 hour drive from where you are likely to stay Flights to
                        Barcelona are already on sale and are currently quite reasonable. They will
                        only go up in price, so book ASAP. </p> <p>Airlines:</p> <ul> <li>Easyjet
                          <li>British Airways <li>Vueling </ul> </p> <p> And so on… When the flights are
                            first released, they are likely to be at their cheapest, so we encourage you
                            to book promptly. </p>
