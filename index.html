<p>If you are looking at staying for 1-2 nights, we recommend staying close to or at the wedding venue. </p>

<p><a href="www.hotelcastellemporda.com/en">Hotel Castell D’Empordà</a> have a large number of rooms.</p>
<p>Close by: There are also villas, apartments and hotels available for short stays in the local town of La Bisbal or in the nearby villages of Monells, Púbol, Peratallada.</p>
<p>If you are thinking of coming for a long weekend or more, we recommend that you stay on the coast and travel inland for the wedding celebrations. </p>
<p>We will be staying close to Sa Riera and over the course of the weekend, we plan to arrange a few other events in these areas. More details to follow on that.</p>
<h4>Aparthotel</h4>
<p>If you’re looking for the best value, well-located apartments/ small group villas, we recommend the <a href="http://www.aparthotelgolfbeach.com/es/allotjaments">Aparthotel at Golf Beach</a></p>
<p>Located at approximately a 15-minute drive from Sa Riera.</p>
<p>If you are interested in the Aparthotel please let us know and we will try to arrange the best price for you.</p>

<h4>Private villas and apartments by the coast</h4>
<p>There are a wide range of private villas and apartments in the area, ranging in quality, price point and size.</p>
<p>Vicky (Alice’s mum) has worked in the area for many years and is keen to help with your accommodation search in any way she can. Think of her as your personal travel agent ☺ victoria@spanishescape.co.uk</p>

  </p>

  <img
    id="flights"
    class="pure-img sectionTitle"
    src="flights.png"/>
<p>Flights are now available and prices are likely to rise as we get closer to the date, so we recommend booking as early as possible.</p>
<p>When deciding when to travel, please bear in mind that it is not only the long bank holiday weekend, but also the first weekend of May half term. If possible, avoid peak flights by flying Friday-Tuesday, for example. Secondly, the wedding will begin late on Saturday afternoon (approx. 4pm) so you have the option to fly early on Saturday morning, should that be more convenient.</p>

    <p>There are two options of airports:</p>

  <h4>Girona (GRO)</h4>

  <p>
    Approximately a 40 minute drive from where you are likely to stay

  <p>Airlines:</p>

  <ul><li>Ryanair</li><li>Tui</li><li>Jet2.com</li></ul>

  <p></p>

  <h4>Barcelona El Prat (BCN)</h4>

  <p>
    Approximately a 2 hour drive from where you are likely to stay.
  </p>

  <p>Airlines:</p>
  <ul><li>Easyjet</li><li>British Airways</li><li>Vueling</li></ul>

  <p></p>

  <p>
    And so on… When the flights are first released, they are likely to     be at their cheapest, so
    we encourage you to book promptly.

  <p>We’ve given a few tips on places to see and things to do around the area while you’re there.</p>

<h4>Best beaches</h4>
<p>There are a huge number and variety of beaches in the area, here are our top picks:</p>
<ul><li>Calella De Palafrugell (Alice’s favourite in the world)</li>
<li>Sa Riera (A classic Costa Bravan cove close to Begur)</li>
<li>Llafranc (Good for a seafront lunch)</li>
<li>Playa del Castel (A really beachy beach for beach lovers)</li></ul>

<h4>Towns:</h4>
<ul><li>Begur (A wonderful town sat on the top of the hills straight up from the coast. A crumbling medieval castle overlooks a cosy town of squares for drinking and eating, Cuban inspired architecture and winding alleys of restaurants and shops)</li>
<li>Pals Old Town (An excellently maintained medieval town – for a low-key afternoon stroll)</li>
<li>Girona (An attractive city of pebble streets, with some excellent restaurants and ice cream shops and a filming location for a load of Game of Thrones (apparently)</li>
<li>Peratallada (Alice hasn’t ever even suggested that I go there, so I can’t give you any insight, but the pictures look nice and apparently the bridesmaids really like this little Catalonian village with great value lunch menus…and pottery)</li></ul>

<h4>Other Activities</h4>
<p>Walk up the hill at Torroella De MontPgri (Affectionately known as the Bishop, because of its resemblance to a Bishop on his back, sticking up from the flat fields – there is a fort sat on top of this 300metre high hill. It’s a nice steep walk, with some nice views over the plains (where it mostly rains in Spain) and is a decent way to burn off some paella. The <a href="https://www.outdooractive.com/en/hiking-trail/spain/costa-brava-2014-10-03/103066813/#dmdtab=oax-tab2">website link </a>says that the round walk from the town, up and down the Bishop should take about 4 hours, I think that’s probably ambling pace, but gives you an idea)</p>

<p><a href="http://kartingregencos.com/serveis-karting/">Go Kart at Karting Regencos</a> (An Opie holiday classic. Its an outdoor track, that doesn’t require booking and has a shack bar for those not driving. Its located a couple of minutes outside of Begur by car. It’s a sharp turning off the main road, up a dirt track, but its worth it when you get there. </p>

<p><a href="http://www.masoller.es/lang-en/">Wine Tasting at Mas Oller</a> (There are excellent wines all around this area and this producer will give you the tour of the vineyards and obviously a number of varieties to try – for around €17 - )</p>

<h4>If you are staying for a bit longer and looking slightly further a field</h4>
<ul><li>Barcelona (Loads to see and do)</li>
<li>Figueres (The home of the Salvador Dali museum…who once tried to buy our wedding venue with a few of his paintings)</li>
