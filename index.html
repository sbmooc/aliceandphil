      If you are looking at staying for 1-2 nights, we recommend staying close to the wedding venue in the town of La Bisbal or in the nearby villages of Monells, Púbol, Peratellada. There are villas, apartments and hotels available for short stays.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you are thinking of coming for a long weekend or more, we recommend that you stay on the coast and travel inland for the wedding celebrations. We will be staying close to Sa Riera and can recommend accommodation both there and in Begur, Sa Tuna, Tamariu and Calella de Palafrugell. Over the course of the weekend, we plan to arrange a few other events in these areas. More details to follow on that.
